# Accessibility Statement

At Eventee, we are committed to ensuring digital accessibility for everyone,
including those with disabilities. We believe in providing an inclusive and
seamless experience for all users, regardless of their abilities. We strive to
adhere to the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 Level AA standards
to ensure our website and digital platforms are accessible to individuals with
diverse needs.

## Our Commitment

Eventee is dedicated to making our digital platforms accessible to all users,
including those with visual, auditory, motor, and cognitive impairments. We
continuously work towards improving the accessibility of our website and
applications to provide an optimal user experience for everyone.

## Accessibility Features

To enhance accessibility, we have implemented various features including:

1. **Keyboard Navigation:** Our website and applications can be navigated easily
   using only a keyboard, ensuring individuals who cannot use a mouse or
   touchscreen can still access all features.
2. **Screen Reader Compatibility:** We have optimized our digital content to be
   compatible with screen reader software, allowing users with visual
   impairments to access and interact with our platforms effectively.
3. **Alternative Text:** We provide descriptive alternative text for images and
   multimedia content, enabling users with visual impairments to understand the
   content through screen readers or text-only browsers.
4. **Color Contrast:** We maintain sufficient color contrast throughout our
   digital interfaces to ensure readability for users with low vision or color
   blindness.
5. **Resizable Text:** Users can adjust the text size and font settings
   according to their preferences, providing flexibility for individuals with
   visual impairments or reading difficulties.
6. **Accessible Forms:** Our forms are designed to be accessible and easy to
   navigate, with clear labels and instructions for screen reader users.
